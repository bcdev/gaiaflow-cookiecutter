Please delete me, I am just a placeholder for your actual data.

If you have the data stored locally on your system, you can move it here so that the Gaiaflow framework has access to it.

Although, it is recommended that you develop your package while testing with a small portion of the data by uploading
it the local MinIO store that is created in the Gaiaflow framework.

If you are pulling it via S3 AWS, you can move some of it for testing and development to the MinIO backend.
