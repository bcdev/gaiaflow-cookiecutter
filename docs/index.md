Welcome to GaiaFlow — an MLOps project template designed to streamline Earth Observation machine learning projects with best practices and automation.

---

## What is GaiaFlow?

The name `GaiaFlow` combines **Gaia** (the Greek goddess of Earth, symbolizing our planet) with **Flow** (representing seamless workflows in MLOps). This template provides a comprehensive framework for building, testing, and deploying ML workflows tailored for remote sensing projects.

It integrates essential tools for modern MLOps pipelines:

- **Apache Airflow** for orchestrating workflows and scheduling ML pipelines.
- **MLflow** for tracking experiments, managing model versions, and model registry.
- **JupyterLab** for interactive data exploration and development.
- **MinIO** for local S3-compatible storage of datasets and artifacts.
- **Minikube** for local lightweight Kubernetes.

---

## Why use GaiaFlow?

- Standardizes ML project structure and workflows.
- Provides an easy-to-use local MLOps environment.
- Ensures reproducibility and seamless CI/CD pipeline integration.
- Supports scalable, production-ready deployments.
- Built with open-source tools widely used in industry.

---

## Who is this for?

- Data scientists and ML engineers working on Earth Observation projects.
- Teams wanting to implement standardized and repeatable ML workflows.
